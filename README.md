## How to run this project from GitHub
### Method 1 : Using Binder
* MyBinder.org is a great project that allows you to create virtualized Jupyter Notebook environment from any GitHub repository. 
* You just need to enter the URL, and Binder will create a container for you, and start Jupyter environment. 
* Many repositories with Jupyter Notebooks include Launch Binder button to open the repository in Binder automatically.

* Binder will try to setup an environment best suited for your needs.

### Method 2 : Using GitHub Codespaces
* GitHub Codespaces is a great feature of GitHub that allows you to open any repository in a virtualized environment in the cloud, and access it through either online VS Code editor in your browser, or through local VS Code installation. 
* Currently, you may sign up for beta access to Codespaces, which will include some free compute to run your notebooks on.

### Method 3 : Run it in your local Python environment
* You can download the notebook from my GitHub repository and run it in your local Python environment using either browser interface to Jupyter/JupyterLab, or Visual Studio Code.
